    Here is the source code: 

    <code style="display: block; white-space: pre-wrap;">
        #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
        #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
        #include &lt;string.h&gt;
        char buf[32];
        int main(int argc, char* argv[], char* envp[]){
        if(argc&lt;2){
          printf("pass argv[1] a number\n");
          return 0;
          }
          int fd = atoi( argv[1] ) - 0x1234;
          int len = 0;
          len = read(fd, buf, 32);
          if(!strcmp("LETMEWIN\n", buf)){
          printf("good job :)\n");
          system("/bin/cat flag");
          exit(0);
          }
          printf("learn about Linux file IO\n");
          return 0;

          }
    </code>

    So what this does is compare the number of arguments to 2, if it isn't, the program exits.
    the fd variable is equal to argv[1] - 0x1234 and len is equal to the length of the input of the user which is stored in buf.
    we compare buf to "LETMEWIN\n" and if its is, we win and otherwise we lose. The only catch is that the program reads from the argv[1] fd. so we need to set it to 0 which is stdin. we can solve for x:
    0 = argv[1] - 0x1234
    argv[1] = 0x1234 = 4660

    So argv[1] needs to be 4660. Let's try that: 
    fd@pwnable:~$ ./fd 4660
    LETMEWIN
    good job :)
